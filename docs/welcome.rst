About the docs
************************

ASGuard documentation is contained in the ``docs/``
folder of the asguard repository.
You are part of the target audience of the ``docs/``, if you are looking for:

    - A starting point on how to use (setup, run, evaluate) ASGuard
    - A Documentation of low level building blocks developed for ASGuard
    - A Tutorial on how to start developing and debugging ASGuard
    - A Troubleshooting Guide for ASGuard or the ASGKernel
    - Implementation Details of ASGuard
    - Something to satisfy your curiosity about ASGuard in general

However, please checkout the scientific paper of ASGuard
if you are looking for a presentation of ASGuard's architecture.
We will not describe ASGuard and its architecture in the docs, since
it is subject to change often, fast and drastically.

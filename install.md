We use ansible playbooks to build, install and test ASGARD. The playbooks can be found at the [ASGARD-Eval](https://github.com/Distributed-Systems-Programming-Group/ASGARD-Eval) Repository.

The inventory file must be adapted to your target environment. 
Adapt username and ip addresses in the inventory files. 
Make sure that python and ssh is running on the target machines.
